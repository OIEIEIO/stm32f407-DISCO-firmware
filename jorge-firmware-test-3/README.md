This code has four different LED patterns, which can be toggled through by pressing the user button on the STM32F407 Discovery board:

Chasing Pattern: LEDs light up one after the other in a sequence.
All LEDs Blinking: All LEDs blink simultaneously.
LEDs Light Up One by One: All LEDs light up one after the other and stay on.
LEDs Turn Off One by One: LEDs turn off one after the other.
The code uses a switch statement to handle the different patterns based on the value of the pattern variable. The pattern variable is incremented every time the user button is pressed, and it wraps around after the fourth pattern.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

The LEDs and the user button are initialized.
A while(1) loop continuously checks the state of the user button.
If the button is pressed, the code waits a short time (for debouncing) and checks the button state again. If the button is still pressed, the pattern variable is incremented, and the code waits for the button to be released.
The value of the pattern variable determines which LED pattern is executed. The switch statement handles the different patterns.
Each case in the switch statement corresponds to a different LED pattern.
To use this code, you'll need to ensure that you have the necessary initialization code for the STM32F407 Discovery board, including the system clock configuration and any other required initializations. If you're using an IDE like STM32CubeIDE or Keil, the initialization code is typically generated for you when you create a new project.
